# Hiding-Video-in-Images-using-Deep-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
This is a preliminary attempt on hiding video data inside images using deep learning. We design a custom adversarial network with custom losses and additional discriminator. We call this multi-discriminator and multi-objective training framework.
